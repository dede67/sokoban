* Dedes Sokoban requires a **Python interpreter** in version 2.7.x.
* Also required is **wxWidgets** (or **wxPython**) in version 2.8, **python-lxml** and **sqlite3**.

The file that has to be started is `SokoMain.py`.
The database for solutions (`soko2db.sqlite` - with 3037 solutions) has to be placed in the home-directory.

The full documentation (in german language) is available at my [homepage](http://dede67.bplaced.net/PhythonScripte/sokobanV2/sokoban.html).

Sources for levels are:
* [sokobano.de](http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Links#Levels_for_Downloading)
* [sourcecode.se](http://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels)
